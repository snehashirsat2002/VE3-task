# VE3 QA Automation Assignment 

This project is a complete automation framework designed for the VE3 QA Internship assignment. It covers UI automation for VE3's official website using Java, Selenium WebDriver, and TestNG, along with data-driven testing, logging, and detailed reporting.

## 🧱 Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate automation skills through real-world scenarios:
- Homepage load verification
- Search functionality with valid & invalid inputs
- Contact form submission (valid & invalid data)
- Data-driven testing using Excel
- Screenshots and logs for failures
- HTML reporting (ExtentReports)
- Defect logging & documentation

## ⚙️ Prerequisites and How to Run

### ✅ Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- Maven installed and configured
- Chrome browser + matching ChromeDriver (placed in `/drivers/`)
- IntelliJ or Eclipse IDE

### ▶️ Steps to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/VE3-QA-Automation-Assignment.git
   cd VE3-QA-Automation-Assignment
2. Run the tests:
   mvn clean test
3. Open the report:
   Navigate to /reports/VE3Report.html to view results
   Screenshots will be saved in /screenshots/


📝 Notes
  ✅ Project follows Page Object Model (POM) for modular and clean design

  ⚠️ The site uses Cloudflare protection, so repeated automation may trigger security blocks. Use your real Chrome profile to avoid this.

  🧪 reCAPTCHA or bot protection might prevent some form submissions — tests are written to handle valid/invalid flows separately

  📌 Test data is managed through an Excel sheet located in test-data/searchData.xlsx
